            <p>Apart from my career and academics, the one thing I am passionate about is <i class="fa fa-futbol-o"></i>
                - AKA football (people call it soccer here in America). I like to play football.
                Due to a recent injury in my right foot while playing football, resulting in a minor surgery, I haven't
                played much. As much as I like to play football, I also love
                watching football. I passionately support and follow FC Barcelona (very famous spanish football club).
                Even more than FC Barcelona, I am a huge fan of Lionel Messi who was the talisman for FC Barcelona
                for over a decade until he left for Paris Saint Germain. I also like to play a lot of FIFA (football on
                playstation) in my free time. Yes I am
                that much obsessed with football.</p>
            <p>I also like to cook. Especially trying out new recipes from different cuisines around the world. Do let
                me know if you have any good recipes from your hometown. </p>
            <p>I like to go on vacations around the world. My most recent destination was Yellowstone National Park that
                I visited during the fall break of 2021. </p>
