                <h3>Current career objective</h3>
                <p>I am an aspiring full stack developer and a software developer, passionate about web technologies,
                    big data and open source software.</p>

                <h3>Journey so far...</h3>
                <p>As a kid my first awe inspiring moment with technology was when it enabled millions of people book
                    train tickets at the click of a button instead of the hours of waiting in lines at ticket counters.
                    The next moment came when I saw my grandfather, a farmer in my native village using computerized
                    land records and checking market prices for their farm produce in the Community Computer Centre. I
                    was truly convinced of the power of Computer Science and Technology reaching common man, empowering
                    people with new tools and changing the lives of millions of Indians. I had found my calling and
                    decided to pursue a career in Computer Science.</p>
                <p>I actively sought internships throughout my undergraduate program to further my knowledge and gain
                    practical experience. In the summer of 2017 I interned at TechMojo Solutions, and got good hands-on
                    experience with NodeJS for server side programming and Redis to make web pages load faster by
                    avoiding unnecessary database hits. With the knowledge gained, I have become an active contributor
                    to open source projects online. I am inspired by the positive contribution that open source software
                    stack makes, by driving efficiencies to SDLC, reducing time to market, cutting down TCO and thus
                    drive down overall cost of online products. I too contributed by creating a backend for blogging
                    platforms using NodeJS and MongoDB which is available to the open source community by simply
                    following the documentation provided on my GitHub. And I intend to remain an active contributor to
                    the open source stack for life.</p>
                <p>In my final semester of undergrad, I interned with DeltaX (an AdTech company that was chosen for the
                    10th Edition
                    of Blackbox Connect Winter 2015 programme at Silicon Valley), where I developed multiple
                    cross-browser extensions that help the company clients in managing their advertisements on Google,
                    Facebook, Bing and many more platforms. After successfully completing the internship, DeltaX offered
                    me a full-time employment for the role of a full-stack developer. I am very grateful to the
                    engineering team at DeltaX as I was given the opportunity to learn and build modern full-stack
                    applications.</p>
                <p>I am currently pursuing my masters degree in Computer Science at Rochester Institute of Technology in
                    NY state.</p>
