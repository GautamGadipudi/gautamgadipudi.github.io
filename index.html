                <h3>Current career objective</h3>
                <p>Experienced backend and cloud infrastructure engineer seeking a challenging role at a mission-driven
                    tech company, where I can build scalable systems that improve lives and make a meaningful impact
                    through technology.</p>
                <h3>Journey so far...</h3>
                <p>As a child, I was amazed when technology made booking train tickets instant, replacing long queues.
                    Later, seeing my grandfather, a farmer, use digital land records and check market prices at a
                    village computer center deeply inspired me. I realized the power of technology to empower everyday
                    people—and that’s when I knew I wanted to pursue a career in Computer Science.</p>
                <p>During my undergraduate studies, I interned at TechMojo Solutions, where I worked with NodeJS and
                    Redis to improve web performance. This hands-on experience sparked my interest in open source—not
                    just for the technical learning, but for its power to democratize innovation, reduce development
                    costs, and accelerate progress. Contributing to open source allows me to share solutions,
                    collaborate globally, and build tools that others can freely use and improve. It's a way for me to
                    give back while continuously learning and growing as an engineer.</p>
                <p>In my final undergraduate semester, I interned at DeltaX, an AdTech company selected for the 10th
                    edition of Blackbox Connect in Silicon Valley. There, I developed cross-browser extensions to help
                    clients manage their ads across platforms like Google, Facebook, and Bing. Following the internship,
                    I was offered a full-time role as a full-stack developer. Working with the talented engineering team
                    at DeltaX gave me valuable experience in building modern, scalable applications and sharpened my
                    skills across the tech stack.</p>
                <p>Following my industry experience, I pursued my Master’s in Computer Science at Rochester Institute of
                    Technology. There, I deepened my understanding in areas such as Computer Networking, Big Data
                    Analytics, and Intelligent Systems. During this period, I interned at Hewlett Packard Enterprise as
                    a Data Engineering intern, where I was introduced to Go for the first time while working on
                    telemetry data collection systems. The elegance and performance of the language immediately captured
                    my interest, and I found myself thoroughly engaged in the challenges of building efficient backend
                    systems.</p>
                <p>After completing my internship and graduating with my Master’s degree, I joined HPE full-time as a
                    Cloud Developer in the Platform Infrastructure Engineering team. This role gave me extensive
                    hands-on experience in designing and building scalable applications and deploying them across both
                    cloud environments and on-premise Kubernetes clusters. I worked on integrating crucial components
                    such as monitoring, alerting, upgradability, logging, and backup/restore features, which are
                    essential for enterprise-grade systems. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also
                    taught me the importance of reliability, observability, and maintainability in distributed systems.
