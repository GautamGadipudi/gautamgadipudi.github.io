                <!-- <p>I am an aspiring full stack developer and a software developer, passionate about web technologies,
                    big data and open source software.</p> -->

                Hello! My name is Gautam, I am an aspiring 
                <div class="flip-box">
                    <div id="flipText" class="flip-content">Software Engineer</div>...
                </div>

                <h3>Journey so far...</h3>
                <p>As a kid my first awe inspiring moment with technology was when it enabled millions of people book
                    train tickets at the click of a button instead of the hours of waiting in lines at ticket counters.
                    The next moment came when I saw my grandfather, a farmer in my native village using computerized
                    land records and checking market prices for their farm produce in the Community Computer Centre. I
                    was truly convinced of the power of Computer Science and Technology reaching common man, empowering
                    people with new tools and changing the lives of millions of Indians. I had found my calling and
                    decided to pursue a career in Computer Science.</p>
                <p>I actively sought internships throughout my undergraduate program to further my knowledge and gain
                    practical experience. In the summer of 2017 I interned at TechMojo Solutions, and got good hands-on
                    experience with NodeJS for server side programming and Redis to make web pages load faster by
                    avoiding unnecessary database hits. With the knowledge gained, I have become an active contributor
                    to open source projects online. I am inspired by the positive contribution that open source software
                    stack makes, by driving efficiencies to SDLC, reducing time to market, cutting down TCO and thus
                    drive down overall cost of online products. I too contributed by creating a backend for blogging
                    platforms using NodeJS and MongoDB which is available to the open source community by simply
                    following the documentation provided on my GitHub. And I intend to remain an active contributor to
                    the open source stack for life.</p>
                <p>In my final semester of undergrad, I interned with DeltaX (an AdTech company that was chosen for the
                    10th Edition of Blackbox Connect Winter 2015 programme at Silicon Valley), where I developed
                    multiple cross-browser extensions that help the company clients in managing their advertisements on
                    Google, Facebook, Bing and many more platforms. After successfully completing the internship, DeltaX
                    offered me a full-time employment for the role of a full-stack developer. I am very grateful to the
                    engineering team at DeltaX as I was given the opportunity to learn and build modern full-stack
                    applications.</p>
                <p>Following my industry experience, I pursued my Master’s in Computer Science at Rochester Institute of
                    Technology. There, I deepened my understanding in areas such as Computer Networking, Big Data
                    Analytics, and Intelligent Systems. During this period, I interned at Hewlett Packard Enterprise as
                    a Data Engineering intern, where I was introduced to Go for the first time while working on
                    telemetry data collection systems. The elegance and performance of the language immediately captured
                    my interest, and I found myself thoroughly engaged in the challenges of building efficient backend
                    systems.</p>
                <p>After completing my internship and graduating with my Master’s degree, I joined HPE full-time as a
                    Cloud Developer in the Platform Infrastructure Engineering team. This role gave me extensive
                    hands-on experience in designing and building scalable applications and deploying them across both
                    cloud environments and on-premise Kubernetes clusters. I worked on integrating crucial components
                    such as monitoring, alerting, upgradability, logging, and backup/restore features, which are
                    essential for enterprise-grade systems. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also
                    taught me the importance of reliability, observability, and maintainability in distributed systems.
