                <h3>Current career objective</h3>
                <p>I am an aspiring full stack developer, passionate about web technologies and big data. Actively looking for a dynamic internship in Spring and Summer 2021 for the role of Software Engineering intern.</p>

                <h3>Journey so far...</h3>
                <p>As a kid my first awe inspiring moment with technology was when it enabled millions of people book train tickets at the click of a button instead of the hours of waiting in lines at ticket counters. The next moment came when I saw my grandfather, a farmer in my native village using computerized land records and checking market prices for their farm produce in the Community Computer Centre. I was truly convinced of the power of Computer Science and Technology reaching common man, empowering people with new tools and changing the lives of millions of Indians. I had found my calling and decided to pursue a career in Computer Science.</p>
                <p>I excelled in my academics and scored GPA of 9.8/10 in Mathematics and GPA of 10/10 in all other subjects in 10th Standard Board exams. I completed my Senior Secondary Education with an overall score of 95.5% electing Mathematics and Science subjects to pursue an engineering degree in Computer Science. I secured admission in Bachelor of Technology (B. Tech) in one of the top ranking engineering colleges in India – Manipal Institute of Technology (MIT), Manipal which is part of Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE) ranked #1 best private university in India in 2018 by 3 prominent ranking agencies, The Week, India Today and Education World. It was a dream come true to go to the same college where Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft had received his degree. The coursework offered in my B. Tech program laid a strong foundation towards my understanding of computer systems and its working at different layers. This further roused my interest in advanced areas of Distributed Systems, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Web technologies.</p>
                <p>I actively sought internships throughout my undergraduate program to further my knowledge and gain practical experience. In the summer of 2017 I interned at TechMojo Solutions, and got good hands-on experience with NodeJS for server side programming and Redis to make web pages load faster by avoiding unnecessary database hits. With the knowledge gained, I have become an active contributor to open source projects online. I am inspired by the positive contribution that open source software stack makes, by driving efficiencies to SDLC, reducing time to market, cutting down TCO and thus drive down overall cost of online products. I too contributed by creating a backend for blogging platforms using NodeJS and MongoDB which is available to the open source community by simply following the documentation provided on my GitHub. And I intend to remain an active contributor to the open source stack for life.</p>
                <p>In my final semester, I interned with DeltaX (an AdTech company that was chosen for the 10th Edition of Blackbox Connect Winter 2015 programme at Silicon Valley), where I developed multiple cross-browser extensions that help the company clients in managing their advertisements on Google, Facebook, Bing and many more platforms. After successfully completing the internship, DeltaX offered me a full-time employment. So, here I am, currently working with them as a Full-Stack Developer in their tracking team where I’m working with huge multi-tenant databases, latest frontend frameworks and .NET MVC. When I was deploying my feature on one of the company’s production VMs, I had to manually look through all VMs to find the right one that satisfied my feature’s usage. I believed that, this process can be automated to recommend the right VM for deploying a service, which could also be extended to scaling the system depending on the demand, all through the use of machine learning concepts applied to distributed systems and virtualization. This led me to seek solutions such as  Docker - an open source software platform to create, deploy and manage virtualized application containers on a common operating system. </p>
                <p>In addition to Web technologies and distributed systems, I believe that Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, will help enhance human creativity in future. My intent to contribute to this field has only grown since the 2018 Google IO keynote, where Sundar Pichai demonstrated booking an appointment with a hair salon through the Google Assistant. But I know the knowledge that I have gained from my undergraduate coursework and the working experience will not be sufficient to reach the summit where I would like to see myself. To further strengthen my skills and continue my research interest, I have decided to pursue my Graduate studies in the field of Computer Science. This will give me an opportunity to learn and contribute towards the research and development in the field of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Distributed systems. I believe that my perseverance and desire to contribute towards these fields will be met through systematic coaching and guidance from a reputed institute specializing in this field. </p>
                <p>During my 3rd year of B. Tech, on a tourist visit to the USA, I went on a campus tour of U of M, Ann Arbor. I realized the difference between typical classroom study here in India and practical, research-oriented learning in US universities and decided to pursue my higher education in USA. Reviewing the research areas at Rochester Institute of Technology, I came across many interesting research areas - “Pervasive and mobile systems” by Dr. Mohan Kumar, “Efficient Deployment and Delivery of Web Services in a Mobile Environment” by Dr. Xumin Liu, and “Computational Social Network Analysis” by Prof. Christopher Homan. Also, the wide Co-op opportunities available in RIT has further fascinated my interests towards joining the Tigers. The journey so far has been great!</p>
